# RecomAalto
Research project for developing a course recommendation system for courses at Aalto University, Finland

Have you ever had the problem of having to choose your electives, but not being able to find the courses that interest you?
This research aims to solve this problem. It uses Machine Learning to recommend courses based on the users wishes.   
Since there is not one best solution, it is ajourney during which I test several techniques.  
So far, I have focused on content-based techniques but collaberative filtering is soon to come! 

The prototype can be tested online via http://recom-pro.herokuapp.com/
