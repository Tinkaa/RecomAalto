# RecomAalto
Research project for developing a course recommendation system for courses at Aalto University, Finland

Have you ever had the problem of having to choose your electives, but not being able to find the courses that interest you?
This research aims to solve this problem. It uses Machine Learning to recommend courses based on the users wishes.   
Its innovativeness lies in using real-world data and working towards an actual implementation. 

In this repository, you can find the simple code of the models and documentation about the project.
Since the data being used is not open data, this has been removed. You can thus draw inspiration from the models and way of working, but have to input your own data.
