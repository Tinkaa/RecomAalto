    "### Content-Based Recommendation\n",
    "This notebook implements a simple recommendation system for courses at Aalto University. \n",
    "The method being used is content-based recommendation, which is one of the two most common recommendation methods. The other being collaberative filtering.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Content based models use information about the items, in our case the courses, and the current user, in our case a student. It then combines this information to give the recommendation. \n",
    "It has been shown to work pretty well and an advantage is that we only need data on the courses and the current user, not about other users.\n",
    "On the other hand, this means that the amount of data is limited and it is hard to suggest a diverse range of items. \n",

    "Now that we have the correct data in place, we want to vectorize the data. \n",
    "By vectorizing we mean giving a number to each word. So that we can calculate the similarities later by comparing those numbers.  \n",
    "As method we use tf-idf which stands for term frequency–inverse document frequency. tf-idf indicates the importance of a certain word compared to the whole corpus.   \n",
    "Tf-idf consists of two terms, the term frequency (tf) and the inverse document frequency (idf). We multiply these two terms to get the tf-idf.    \n",
    "The term frequency in its most basic form states how often word d occurs in document n. Mathematically this can be written as $|d \\in n|$  \n",
    "The inverse document frequency states how important a certain word d is in the whole corpus. For example, 'entrepreneurship' can be very indicative whereas the word 'course' isn't. This is calculated by the total number of courses, N, dived by the number of courses in which the word d occurs, mathematically this can be written as $\\frac{N}{|\\{n \\in N: d \\in n\\}|}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation we expand this a bit by calculating it as $log(\\frac{N}{|\\{n \\in N: d \\in n\\}|})+1$ if $|\\{n \\in N: d \\in n\\}|>0$ else $0$.  \n",
    "We add the log here because the importance of a word is not linear but more sub-linear. If word1 occurs 10 times in the corpus instead of 5 times, the relevance of that word is probably not 2 times as small. The log heavily minimizes the difference in idf between these two cases.  \n",
    "The +1 is added to distinguish between $|\\{n \\in N: d \\in n\\}|<=0$ and $\\frac{N}{|\\{n \\in N: d \\in n\\}|}$=1 since the log of 1 equals 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying the tf with the idf we get an importance score for every word in every course. Pay attention, that this score doesn't only depend on the word, but also on the number of occurences and length of the specific course you are looking at.    \n",
    "In theory the tf-idf will be the highest when a course only has that word d and no other course has that word d. The tf-idf is always larger or equal than zero. "

    "Again, the same logic applies as with the idf. If a word occurs 100 times or 200 times, it might doesn't make the word twice as relevant. The log minimizes the difference in tf between these two cases.    \n",
