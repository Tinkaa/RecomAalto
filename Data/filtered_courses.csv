Wicked global sustainability challenges such as climate change, depletion of natural resources and poverty are treated as starting points for innovation of new forms of economic activity, business models, and organizational forms.

Course Policies and Procedures: Attendance PolicyBecause the in-class experience is an integral part of this course, attendance is required.  You are allowed one absence.  Starting with the second absence, each one is a 4 percentage-point reduction in your participation grade. Based on my discretion, late arrival to class can also count as an absence. Professional Classroom DecorumI will not tolerate IM¿ing, text messaging, email checking, or cell phone use of any kind during class.  I find this behavior personally offensive and disrespectful.  If I perceive you to be engaging in any of these activities, you will receive a zero for participation that day.  Three ¿zeros¿ result in a 4 percentage-point reduction in your grade.  You are guilty if I think you¿re guilty. That¿s the only way I see to enforce the rule. Some examples of practices that are forbidden in class:1.        Checking your phone underneath the desk2.        Checking your IM on your laptop during class3.        Checking any website that is not related to course content during class4.        I also don¿t find it too useful when people sprint to Wikipedia whenever a question arises. 5.        Doing homework for other classes. Think of it this way: some jobs let you do this while at work. Some don¿t. Consider my class in the latter category.

Out of all the subjects that you as a business student might encounter during your studies, consumer behavior is the one you have the most intimate first-hand knowledge with. You were all consumers long before stepping into the hallowed grounds of Aalto University. Yet this familiarity with consumption sometimes makes it difficult to develop a necessary critical or analytical distance. The purpose of this course is to fundamentally challenge the way you understand consumption as an activity and as a topic of study. We will move you beyond colloquial or taken-for-granted understandings of consumption such as conceptually limited tropes like shopping. Understanding consumption is essential for marketing managers in developing effective marketing strategies. That said, we will repeatedly emphasize that to study consumption is not the same as studying customers. The class explores a multitude of concepts and theories from different behavioral sciences to fully appreciate what drives consumption choices and experiences. The course is split into two main paradigms of consumer research: consumer psychology and consumer culture. The consumer psychology side inform participants on psychological processes and biases underlying the decisions made by individuals, with a special emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into consumption-related decisions. As consumers, we are challenged by a large amount and variety of choices every day. These decisions can be as trivial as deciding between Cappuccino or Latte Macchiato for breakfast, but they can also be as impactful as deciding on a job offer or taking a loan for buying a new apartment. Current research estimates that an adult makes about 35,000 remotely conscious decisions each day. Each choice we make, i.e., a decision between various options, bears consequences, positive or negative. During decision-making, we generally attempt to estimate ¿ with varying degrees of intuition and elaboration ¿ the likelihood of an outcome as well as the ramifications of that outcome. Research analyzing such decision-making is typically referred to as Behavioral Science. The module gives participants a broad overview of important results from two major Behavioral Sciences: Behavioral Economics and Consumer Research. To do so, it discusses seminal theories from Economics and Cognitive and Social Psychology, which explore how people make decisions. Moreover, the module offers participants advice about applying these insights to topics in Marketing and Management. Although a number of important concepts will be covered throughout the module, the focus will be largely on understanding heuristics (mental shortcuts or rule of thumbs that are used to increase the efficiency of decision-making) and biases (a systematic error in thinking, in the sense that a judgment deviates from what would be considered a rational choice). In the consumer culture side, we move beyond the individual decision-making brain and investigate the cultural, social, and historical underpinnings of consumption. Here, culture is not to be understood in the colloquial sense (¿Finnish culture is like this, Swedish culture is like that¿). The view of culture we adopt in this course sees consumer culture as the way in which we, as consumers, make sense of and organize our lived experiences through the various resources provided by the marketplace. We investigate issues like how social class structures consumption, how consumption informs the construction of identity, how gender is performed through consumption, and the inner workings of consumer collectives like subcultures and brand communities, just to name a few. Though the concepts presented during the course will be numerous, we will actively encourage reflection, criticism, deeper exploration, and creative applications based on your own interests.

Some don¿t. Consider my class in the latter category. According to a recent study, 73% of ¿phone checking¿ is done out of boredom or habit, almost like a muscle memory impulse. Break the habit.

The rapid changes in tastes and the wide circulation of new fashion innovations, popularised by European courts and promoted by flourishing cloth trade, introduced new concepts into the traditional, local ways of dressing, changing not only the way clothing was made, decorated and worn, but also bringing new values into the systems of dress. Fashionable appearance was no longer associated just with the high cost of the fabric, but the display of new styles and international fashion manufactures such as ruffs, fans, or light silk fabrics, became an important part of the dress culture. This course introduces some of the central themes in contemporary international research of early modern fashion, clothing and textiles in the Mediterranean region (mainly Italy) and Scandinavia. The special topics to be addressed include: Social and cultural meanings of dress; ideas about fashion; novelty in dress; international textile trade and fashion dissemination; making and buying clothing; cultural practices associated with dress. These themes are designed to provide the students, on the one hand, with a basic understanding of historical dress and its social and cultural meanings in early modern European society and, on the other, with tools to evaluate what impact novel fashion products and changing cultural dress habits had on social behaviour, regulation of appearance and the cultural meanings of dress in Europe.",The course belongs to optional art and theory studies organized by the Centre for General Studies,1132870340,2,2018-12-13,0-5,,1133640855,Englanti,['en'],"This interdisciplinary course examines how European fashion developed in fifteenth and sixteenth century Europe.

The course aims to provide students with a methodological understanding of how to obtain new knowledge from visual, written and material evidence in a broad interdisciplinary context.

This lecture and exercise offers a new approach, explaining geometry as the core of the architectural and structural design process. Geometry is omnipresent, from the initial form-finding stages to the structural concept and the actual construction. Modern constructive geometry provides a variety of tools for the efficient design, analysis, and manufacture of complex shapes. This results in new challenges for architecture and structural design. However, the architectural/structural application also poses new problems to geometry. Actual topics include, curvature analysis, freeform curves and surfaces creation, developable surfaces, discretization, generative design, digital prototyping and manufacturing amongst others. Architectural geometry is therefore an entire research area, currently emerging and mediating at the border between applied geometry, structure and architecture. The lectures and exercises in ¿Geometry in Structures and Architecture¿ offer access to this field and thinking. Lightweight: The form of a material object stands not only for its spatial qualities but as well for its structural efficiency. These twofold abilities of forms ¿ the space creating and the structural ¿ are exactly the field this course is going to investigate. By means of lightweight structures, the holistic observation of the processes of creating structures, their geometrically quantifiable traits (forms) and their structural characteristics together lead towards far reaching insights in the fields of methodology, of form-finding and of implementing such structures in real buildings with undreamt of spatial and technological facets. In this regard, we are studying forms, which are related to selforganizing processes. We are investigating their form-families, the processes of creation and development of such forms and structure, and their architecturally interesting qualities as aspects of design. In the same time, we comprehend their exceptional structural properties. From an ecological, social and cultural perspective, lightweight structures have never been more contemporary and necessary than today. Lightweight structures are material-efficient, the materials strengths are optimally used, no resources are wasted and therefore they are superior in meeting the requirement for a sustainable development.

The correct application of NDT can prevent accidents, save lives, protect the environment and avoid economic loss. NDT and inspection are vital functions in achieving the goals of efficiency and quality at an acceptable cost. In many cases, these functions are highly critical: painstaking procedures are adopted to provide the necessary degree of quality assurance. The consequences of failure of engineering materials, components and structures are well known and can be disastrous.

It gives the student a set of historical and conceptual corner stones to understand the role and position of design in society, and insights and vocabulary to anticipate and create design driven cultural and societal changes.   Because of the various cultural backgrounds of the students, the course has a dual agenda. For a foreign student it provides surface of reflection for her to identify the unique features of Finnish design with reference to her own. For a Finnish student, it provides tools to decontextualize the everyday for having a fresh look on the foundations of our material culture.   The course challenges the students to point out and reinterpret phenomena in Finnish design through an exercise following critical approach.  ",syventävät opinnot,Course literature will be announced in advanced.

The exhibition will take place in a venue specifically acquired for the purpose of presenting the work to a wider audience, reaching outside the university context. In addition, the course will provide a platform for a seminar that examines artists' and curators' social agencies, and the prevailing and emerging contours of artistic work. In the seminar we explore a variety of questions related to labour conditions; forms of organising and instituting; and sources and means of funding. The seminar includes a broad selection of visiting speakers from different areas of artistic and theoretical practice. The course weaves together a collective effort to produce and curate a graduate exhibition and a seminar discussing the social infrastructures and landscapes of art and curatorial workers. Whereas the former involves hands-on work related to exhibition display, text production, and event planning, the latter takes the form of a seminar involving a list of required reading, essay work, in-class exercises, and group work.","The course belongs to Master's Programme in Visual Cultures, Curating and Contemporary Art",1132785514,5,2019-05-24,0-5,https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/search.php?search=TAI-E3010,1133613887,"English, may be completed in Finnish or Swedish up request",['en'],"The participants will gain a wide array of knowledges related to exhibition production: collective production of a group exhibition, displaying or performing one's own work in a broader context, and developing a program of discussions, screenings, etc. The students will also gain an understanding about the agential conditions of artistic and curatorial labour in contemporary visual cultures",Master level course,,ViCCA Production,A805,,"Registration via WebOodi.

What is routinely seen as a common denominator is marginality, the position of the outsider. Hence, the notion of outsider art is customarily defined as work created by people with unquiet minds, by people under institutionalisation, psychological challenges or chemical enhancements, or at the very least, by people without any formal training in the arts. What kind of singular artistic agencies and philosophical outlooks get muffled under sweeping notions and processes of normalisation? Is operating at the fringes of official culture an affirmative, creative or political choice, or merely the result of the art world's exclusionary mechanisms? Why are we so drawn to the margins? What kind of dynamics exist between centres and peripheries within contemporary art? The course offers a comprehensive look at unorthodox artistic agencies and cultural 'detritus'. During the course we examine a diversity of artistic practices beyond the established infrastructure of contemporary art (education, funding, museums, galleries, biennales, art fairs). We delve into domains of unfettered experimentality and self-actualisation, and discuss the contours of use value and play tactics. We inquire about the possibilities of transgressing legitimate cultural forms. We look at the uses and abuses of vocabulary to describe singular agencies, and ponder processes of exclusion on the one hand, and mechanisms of reification on the other.

Each time new players become involved in the venture, new decisions have to be made which might have significant influence on the future outcomes. Wasserman refers to the most critical decisions as the founder's dilemmas: The Founder's dilemmas are decisions that involve a tradeoff, hence they are painful to make, and often the easy decision is the wrong one in the long run. These dilemmas form the basis of the case-based learning on the course. Using these cases as examples, we will discuss issues such as how to get the right people engaged in your business idea, how to develop implementation capacity networks through global partnerships, how to grow without losing a start-up culture, and thus, how to building a high-growth, long-term, sustainable firm from scratch.","Master's Programme in Industrial Engineering and Management, optional course.

Circular economy encompasses more than the sustainable production and consumption of material, goods, and services. It includes a discussion of the intertwinement of aesthetical, ecological and ethical processes. Because of this, it has become evident that more radical change of culture, education, values, and ways of living is needed for promoting circular economy. The course develops the key elements of change in consumer culture: knowledge on art and design practices and thinking as well as the significance of the production of culture. For this, it is crucial to understand not only the concrete materiality but also the mental images and the cultural and social materiality that influences consumption habits. In the course, the students work on the phenomena of circular economy through the participatory methods of contemporary art. The course uses different examples of art for grasping the complexity of circular economy in different levels: individual, community, society, and culture.

Students will then be able to develop the idea of what a `prototype¿ means in their own fields and how to use it as a thinking tool in new ways.A prototype is normally defined as ¿a first full-scale and usually functional form of a new type or design of a construction¿ or as ¿a standard or typical example¿ (Webster Dictionary) In connection to artistic work the discussion about prototypes points to material, technical or spatial experiments. In addition to that it also points to experimenting with time or deals with imaginary issues. The prototype discussed during the course is not heading towards production. Instead the experience gathered from a test setup is used to develop the next work in the next test setup. To reject a working setup and to build a new one from scratch is part of proceeding with the work. During the course the students use their own respective fields of interest to build continues prototype situations, i.e. test setups.",Optional course,1132879374,5,2019-04-01,Pass/Fail,,1133642579,English,['en'],"The students learn to examine critically their surroundings and to find out about the role of concepts like ¿efficiency¿, ¿failure¿ or ¿learning¿ in our every day experiences.The students learn to do an experimental artistic work and to put it into the context of an environment.
